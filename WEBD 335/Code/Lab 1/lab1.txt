Create HTML interactions with navigation and transition/animations.  Here are two examples, you can recreate these exactly or you can come up with your own, but your example must meet each of the following objectives:

Build Your Dashboard


Create the “Todo List” and “Action Item Update” User Interface with HTML/CSS and Bootstrap that has at least the following:


a. use the grid layout for your dashboard
b. a responsive s​idebar vertical layout​navigation drawer for smaller device widths, and a t​op​ h​orizontal layout h​eader for larger device widths
c. use a animation or transition for the navigation when the browser width increases and decreases.
d. use at least one table with striped rows (alternating colors)
e. use at least one styled form, with at least four controls and button for submission
f. declare at least one mixin with a preprocessor; if you don’t use it that is fine. (but you must implement at least one mixin). Please specify the mixin that you define, with a comment as part of your submission.
