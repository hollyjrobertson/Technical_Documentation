    <h2>Question 1</h2>
    <p class="question"><strong>[2 point]</strong>
      What is a module in AngularJS and what is the attribute added to the HTML to declare it?
    </p>
      <div class="answer">
        <ul>
          <li>A module in AngularJS is a container of the different parts of an application such as controller, service, filters, directives, factories etc. It supports separation of concern using modules. AngularJS stops polluting global scope by containing AngularJS specific functions in a module. <a href="https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/angularjs/modules-in-angularjs" target="_blank">Source</a></li>
          <li>A module is created by using the AngularJS function <span class="code">angular.module</span></li>
            <ul>
              <li>The <span class="code">myApp</span> parameter refers to an HTML element in which the application will run. </li>
            </ul>

    <h2>Question 2</h2>
    <p class="question"><strong>[2 point]</strong>
      Describe how AngularJS uses ViewModel and why this is different than the way JQuery works?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
        <ul>
          <li>The ViewModel in the <i>Model-View-ViewModel</i> is the glue between the model and view (back-end/front-end). It is responsible for maintaining the relationship between teh view and model. But the main difference between this structure and the JQuery structure is that instead of having the jQuery controller attaching event listeners onto front-end actions, the ViewModel requires the front-end/view to alert the model of an action via the ViewModel. <a href="https://www.htmlgoodies.com/beyond/javascript/the-model-view-viewmodel-pattern-and-angular-development.html" target="_blank">Source-1</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32154741/model-view-viewmodel-in-angularjs/32155403" target="_blank">Source-2</a></li>

    <h2>Question 3</h2>
    <p class="question"><strong>[2 point]</strong>
      When should an AngularJS Service be used?
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>"Factory and Service are the most commonly used recipes. The only difference between them is that Service recipe works better for objects of custom type, while Factory can produce JavaScript primitives and functions." - <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers" target="_blank">AngularJS Docs</a>

    <h2>Question 4</h2>
    <p class="question"><strong>[2 point]</strong>
      What are the two common approaches to structuring an AngularJS application?  Describe them.
    </p>
    <div class="answer">
      <ul>
        <li>Sort By Type</li>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="question4-1.png" /></li>
            <li>This one gets more difficult as the application gets bigger. When you want to find a specific view and its controller, they are in different folders. This can be a good one to start with since it is quite easy to shift to a more advanced structure. <a href="https://johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/" target="_blank">Source</a></li>
          </ul>
        <li>Sort By Feature</li>
          <ul>
            <li><img src="question4-2.png" /></li>
            <li>All of the layout views and controllers go in the <span class="code"> layout </span>folder, the admin content goes in the <span class="code"> admin </span>folder, and the services that are used by all of the areas go in the <span class="code"> services</span> folder. The idea is that when you are looking for the code that makes a feature work, it is located in one place. Services are a bit different as they "service" many features. <a href="https://johnpapa.net/angular-growth-structure/" target="_blank">Source</a></li>
